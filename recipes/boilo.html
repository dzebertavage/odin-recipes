        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Boilo is a boozy staple found throughout Pennsylvania's anthracite coal region. Derived from <em>krupnikas</em> — a traditional Lithuanian honey liqueur — this hot drink is how the descendants of the original Lithuanian coal miners pay homage to their forefathers.</p>
        <p>Although boilo is typically reserved for special occasions, the drink's spices, slightly increased viscosity, and hot temperature are ideal to warm you up on any cool night!</p>
